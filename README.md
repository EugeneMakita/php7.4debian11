## Usage
This Docker image sets its working directory to `/var/www/html`, which means that this is the directory where your PHP application should be mounted in the Docker container.

It exposes port 80, which you can map to the host.

The default command run by the container is `php -S 0.0.0.0:80 -t /var/www/html`, which starts a PHP server listening on port 80 and serving files from the `/var/www/html` directory. You can override this command if you have specific requirements for your application.
